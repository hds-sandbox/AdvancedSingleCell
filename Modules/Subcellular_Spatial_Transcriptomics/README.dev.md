Subcellular spatial transcriptomics with bento-tools downloaded from the documentation of bento-tools github repo. Found in folder docs/source/tutorial_gallery

https://github.com/hds-sandbox/bento-tools_development is the forked repo of bento-tools, to be kept synchronized, from which you can also access the original repo.

I have adjusted some links and added quarto markdowns, so for updates of the original repo, add them by hand or copy/paste the whole notebooks and redo the callouts and links.
