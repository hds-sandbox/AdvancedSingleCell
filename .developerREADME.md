# Instructions for developer:

- Use Quarto 1.3.450 which does not have bugs related to reading metadata for ipynb

- Convert each ipynb notebook into `ipynb` format, so that the content will be formatted for usage, running 

`for i in `ls *.ipynb`; do quarto render $i --to ipynb; done`

- The formatted notebook has suffix `.out.ipynb`. Callout boxes have to be REDONE MANUALLY at the moment since there is no working rendering of those in quarto at the moment. Once those are done, copy the notebooks into the `Notebooks` folder for the users.
