# Advanced single cell analysis

This repository contains multiple independent modules to execute advanced single cell analysis. Modules are mostly in form of tutorials. You can [refer to the repository's webpage](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/AdvancedSingleCell) to see all the modules we have created. The repository will be populate over time with both examples in the `R` and  `python` programming languages, with some eventual additions of the `bash` command line. This repository contains also the environments to recreate locally the modules and a Docker container to export the material to other computing clusters.

## Data availability

For each module, the related data is downloadable from the Zenodo repository shown in the webpage.
